The medieval period, or the Middle Ages, spans about a thousand years
between the fall of the Roman Empire, which occurred around 500 CE, and
the beginning of the European Renaissance, which was a bit later in
England around 1500 CE. The idea of a period called the Middle Ages was
a product of later thinkers who contrasted the explosive creativity and
cultural transformation of the Renaissance with the seemingly subdued
work of earlier centuries. Many saw this earlier period as less
intellectually and culturally valuable. It is worth noting that
contemporary historians often refer to the Renaissance as the Early
Modern. The ideas, values, and tastes of this period are more in
alignment with our own, and it is easy to appreciate and identify with
them more than with those of earlier times. Nonetheless, the Middle Ages
produced artistic works that not only reveal the culture and thought of
that age, but also link strongly with artistic representations from
later ages, including our own. Many fundamental ideas of western culture
developed in this middle period. Although the Renaissance is
traditionally touted as a period of particularly explosive creativity
and cultural rebirth, we will discover that art, literature, and
philosophy certainly flourished in the Middle Ages as well. This survey
course has been designed in order to introduce you to the very origins
of literary expression in the English language. We will identify and
examine the forms, genres, literary conventions, and topics of concern
that typify medieval literature. Because all literary works are
intertextual to some degree, we will begin to recognize the many
relationships and discursive practices that these works share with other
texts across centuries and around the globe. In recognition of the vast
time range and large amount of material to be covered, this course will
approach literature as a product of specific historical and cultural
circumstances. To foster this understanding, this course has been
divided into three chronological units: Anglo-Saxon England and Old
English poetry; Anglo-Norman England and the Romances; and Middle
English Literature. At the outset of each unit, we will explore the
historical and cultural background of the period, and then we will read
representative texts.
