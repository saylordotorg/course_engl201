*We will begin this unit with an overview of the Anglo-Saxon invasions
of England and the conversion of the island to Christianity in the 6th

conventions with particular care, learning to recognize the alliterative
line and appreciate the genre’s relationship to the Anglo-Saxon oral
tradition.*

Instructions: Read Dr. Glenn’s translation of an excerpt from “The
Battle of Maldon”. You may also choose to review “The Wanderer,”
which you read in subunit 1.2.2. From Old English Literature’s
“Wanderer,” read the essays titled “Introduction to the Poem,”
“Criticism,” and “Synopsis of the Poem.” You may access these essays
by clicking on “Context” in the navigation bar at the top of the

Like many Old English poems, “The Wanderer” is elegiac in tone and
structurally complex. It was preserved in the Exeter Book (c. 975),
the largest surviving collection of Old English poetry. What we now
call “The Battle of Maldon” is a fragment of what seems to have been
a much longer poem. It is an excellent example of the comitatus
ethos.
