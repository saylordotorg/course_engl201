**Unit 2: Anglo-Norman England and the Romances  ** <span
id="2"></span> 

*We will begin by situating ourselves in Anglo-Norman England, just
after the Normans took possession of England in the decisive Battle of
Hastings in 1066. Between the introduction of the Normans’ French
language and the popularity of orally-transmitted Celtic legends and
tales, England found itself in an environment ripe for cultural and
linguistic exchange - and the literature from this period manifests this
hybridity. In this unit, we will study the emergence of the new romance
genre, from The Lais of Marie de France to the knightly adventures of
Chretien de Troyes, identifying recurring themes and tropes and
exploring the Anglo-Norman fascination with the Court of King Arthur.*
