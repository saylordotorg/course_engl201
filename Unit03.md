**Unit 3: Middle English Literature** <span id="3"></span> 

*In this final unit, we will review the turbulent history of the late
Medieval period, from England’s involvement in a number of wars to the
outbreak of the bubonic plague in the 14thcentury. We will also chart
the key social and cultural changes of the times: the rise of the
merchant class, the linguistic transition from the French of the
Anglo-Norman Period to Middle English, and the changing perspectives on
the Church. With these contexts in mind, we will explore developments in
the romance genre and study the many literary innovations of Geoffrey
Chaucer and his Canterbury Tales, including his break from alliterative
verse and his thematic attention to social dynamics and class relations.
Finally, we will examine religious works written during this late
period, including the mystical writings of anchoresses like Julian of
Norwich and the growth of religiously-oriented drama as a popular
genre.*

**3.3.5 “The Miller’s Tale: The Prologue” and Conventions of Satire  **
<span id="3.3.5"></span> 
-   **Reading: Chaucer’s *The Canterbury Tales*: “The Miller’s Tale: The
    Prologue” and Carson-Newman College: Dr. L. Kip Wheeler’s “Literary
    Terms and Definitions”: “Medieval Estates Satire”**

    Link: Chaucer’s *The Canterbury Tales*: [“The Miller’s Tale: The
    Prologue”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/THE-CANTERBURY-TALES-2.pdf)
    (PDF) and Carson-Newman College: Dr. L. Kip Wheeler’s “Literary
    Terms and Definitions”: [“Medieval Estates
    Satire”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Medieval-estates-satire.pdf) (PDF)

    Instructions: Read “The Miller’s Tale: The Prologue” from *The
    Canterbury Tales*, as well as Dr. Wheeler’s definition of “Medieval
    Estates Satire” for more information about the specific historical
    context and genre of “The Miller’s Tale.”  

    Note the following information about “The Miller’s Tale.” The order
    of story-telling is significant. The story follows “The Knight’s
    Tale,” and since the knight holds the highest social rank of the
    Canterbury pilgrims, his story reflects this ranking. It is a tale
    of classical chivalry and serious ethical issues. “The Miller’s
    Tale,” however, is a bawdy story with the plot based on two stock
    fabliaux. A fabliaux is a short, usually ironic, and lewd story
    which is often quite funny. These stories were popular throughout
    the middle ages and were extremely popular in 14th century England.
    The Miller succeeds the Knight in story-telling order, which does
    not follow social protocol at all, but the rude tale does form a
    distinct counterpoint to the elegant “The Knight’s Tale,” and serves
    notice that Chaucer’s fictive social will not follow expected
    conventions. Note the use of puns and language play in the story.

**3.3.6 “The Wife of Bath’s Tale: The Prologue”: Feminism and

    Tale: The Prologue”**

    Prologue”](https://resources.saylor.org/archived/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/THE-CANTERBURY-TALES-2.pdf)
    (PDF)  
      
     Instructions: Read this text. “The Wife of Bath’s Tale” and its
    “Prologue” are among the most discussed of the Canterbury pilgrim
    stories. Contemporary feminist critics have claimed the wife as an
    early feminist, but most critics respond that this characterization
    is both anachronistic and inaccurate. The wife is a complex
    character, and Chaucer lavishes her with descriptive detail. “The
    Prologue” opens with her claiming her authority in matters of
    marriage and sexuality. She presents herself as a defender of
    women’s right to power in relationships. She recites and interprets
    scripture and other learned texts, but it is clear that her learning
    is filled with inaccuracies and her interpretation of scripture is
    suspect. Readers can find reason to like, dislike as well as to feel
    pity, admiration, or disgust for this complex character. Though “The
    Prologue” is long, it offers rewarding insight into the
    characterization of the wife.

    Reading this document should take approximately 5 hours.
